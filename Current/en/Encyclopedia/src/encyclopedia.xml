      <god>
         <name>Aluwen - Goddess of Defense</name>
         <description>The goddess of Life and Truth. She believes strongly
in the goodness of all living things, constantly striving to heal the sick
or wounded. Her chosen race, the Elves, have inherited her love of 
nature and the sanctity of life.

      <god>
         <name>Glydoc - God of Crafting</name>
         <description>A paradoxical god, beset by conflicting natures, he 
tries to maintain neutrality in all things, not daring to swing too far 
in one direction or another. He therefore is the patron of crafting,
most neutral of trades.

         <description>Having attained his godhood through the guidance
of Mortos then being forced into war against Aluwen, Zarin, and Elandria,
Unolas now strives to remain impartial and throws himself into the pursuit
of knowledge and mastery of magic instead.

         <description>A student of Mortos, Selain achieved godhood by his
own efforts, spurned the Assembly, and precipitated the War of the Gods.

         <description>Zarin is constantly fascinated by the variety found in
the souls of mortals and takes infinite care to nourish it. She is the patron of
all artists and rewards all those whose ambitions lead to the development of
the soul. Unfortunately, her methods may be a little too free at times which
earn her some rather doubtful looks from her sisters.

madness against all of the Lands.

        <description>Goblins are ugly, smelly scavengers.
They mostly travel in packs of 5 or 6, but many times they
could also be seen traveling alone. Varying around
5 feet or less in height, they have greenish pock
marked skin, yellowish brown eyes, and wear clothing,
armor and weapons that they pilfered from dead
corpses in graves, an unsuspecting traveler, or each
other. They are usually too stupid to determine if
fighting you is a good or bad thing for them however.

there are some whose souls are cursed and must follow
the remainder of their former selves for eternity.</description>

Standing at around 6-8 feet tall, they have greenish blue-
brown skin, and wear their own unique armor and clothing,
usually finding those from other races to be inferior to
their own weaponry. The females are the weaker
of this fearsome race.</description>

throw out any other humanoid creature they findliving there and will attack you on sight. They arenot as intelligent as the Orcs, and are very grouchyand lazy. Their skin tones vary from a greenishcolor to a human's peach tone, and they're usually
a hulking 8 feet tall with a wide girth (due to
their laziness).
